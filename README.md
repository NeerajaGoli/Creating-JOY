# Creating-JOY
Twilio Hackathon Project

## About

This is an application that’ll bring all the individual donors as well as NGOs under one roof, to facilitate the queries raised by anyone to help the needy (being humans or animals alike).

## How it works

- Provision to list the queries which include information along with a photograph.
- These queries are opened to all the users to like, dislike and accept.
- Provision to delete a query if it reaches the maximum dislikes limit and to decrease the rating of the associated users who posted. Once a user reaches a minimum rating, they’ll be removed.
- Provision to notify the relevant users when someone requests based on location and categories.
- Provision to users who accepted the request to post a picture as a proof so that the user who posted the query can close it. 

## Features

- Interface to post, list and interact with the queries.
- A user can act as a donor or a requestor.
- Push notifications to the nearby users.
- Phone number verification using Twilio API.
