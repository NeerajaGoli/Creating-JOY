# Creating-JOY
Twilio Hackathon Project

## About

This is an application that’ll bring all the individual donors as well as NGOs under one roof, to facilitate the queries raised by anyone to help the needy (being humans or animals alike). 
It's an integrated interface to help you help others.

## How it works

- Provision to list the queries to seek help which will include information such as query text, address along with a photograph of the being in need.
- Provision to view queries by all the visitors.
- Provision to post, like, dislike and accept the queries to registered users.
- Provision to delete a query if it reaches the maximum dislikes limit and to decrease the rating of the associated user who posted. Once a user reaches a minimum rating, they’ll be removed.
- Provision to segregate queries based on categories
- Provision to view requested as well as accepted queries by the user.
